# Workshop 4

## Emphasis

He swung back the fishing pole and cast the line which ell *25 feet away into the river*. The lure landed in the _perfect_ spot and he was sure he would soon get a bite. He never expected that the bite would come from behind in the form of a bear.

## Strong
Nobody really understood Kevin. It wasn't that he was super strange or difficult. It was more that there wasn't enough there that anyone wanted to take the time to understand him. This was a shame as Kevin had many of the answers to the important questions most people who knew him had. It was even more of a shame that they'd refuse to listen **even if Kevin offered to give them the answers.** So, Kevin remained silent, misunderstood, and kept those important answers to life to himself.
